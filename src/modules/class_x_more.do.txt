===== Mapping and Contouring =====
o Build a 3D framework: what data structure to use?
In a geo setting, 2 numbers will be used for the x, y coordinates. A third dimension ($z$) to a property


!split
===== Estimation Techniques =====

o Interpolation

o Extrapolation


!split
===== Contouring =====
Contours: Lines of constant $z$ value.
* Subjective
* Computer algorithms that trance a line through a grid or triangulation
* Colour fill between contour lines


!bblock
It is a traditional method of visualizing a surface
!eblock


!split
===== Gridding =====
* Interpolate to a series of regular grid noted
* Techniques:
  * Nearest Neighbour
  * Moving average
  * Inverse distance
  * Kriging

The resulting 'map' can be then obtained via
* contouring
* assigning colors to cells surrounding the grid nodes


!split
===== Nearest Neighbour =====
Setting up a regular grid
Each grid points takes the values of its closes measurement

!split
===== Inverse distance =====
'IDW': 'https://gisgeography.com/inverse-distance-weighting-idw-interpolation/'


$Z_{i, j} = \frac{\sum^n_{i=1} {z_i/d_i}}{\sum^n_{i=1} {1/d_i}}$



!split
===== Inverse distance Weighting =====
* Modification of the local sample mean method

* Computed weights for each data point depend on some inverse power of the distance to the point to be estimated


!split
===== General interpolation procedure =====

* Select data points (control points) surrounding the point at which you want an estimate Z{i,j}


!split
===== Search value =====
* Data values a long way from the estimation location have very little effect on the estimated value

* Estimation processes can be very sensitive to search radius

* The search region may be elliptical, ellipsoidal, other
Autocorrelograms tell you how far away an effect extends.


!split
===== Cross Validation =====
To check accuracy on the points


!split
===== Auto and Cross Covariance/Correlation =====
Covariance

Correlation

Auto-Covariance (population)

Cross-Covariance (population)

Correlation


!split
===== Auto covariance =====
Compute the covariance between the points in the series and the series shifted by a lag, _h_

!split
===== Comment =====
We cannot assign a distribution out of a single outcome

!split
===== Stationarity =====
It is a fundamental assumptions

!bblock Strict stationarity
All moments are independent of position (transition invariant)
!eblock


!split
===== First order stationarity =====
* Any function (f) of the random variable is invariant under translation

The mean is the same in any region

!split
===== Second order stationarity
* Translation invariance

!split
===== Stationary increment of the Variable =====
A more general assumption is that the *increments* of the variables are stationary.


!split
===== Stationary of increments =====
* Definition
* Constant mean
* Constance Variance
* Autovariance

Example applications:
Financial mathematics (asset returns)  


!split
===== Stationary =====
Stationary means the statistics of the orange points are the same of the statistics of the blue points, for any vector *d*


!split
===== Causes of non-stationary: mixed population =====
* The two regions must be handled (modeled) separately.


!split
===== Comments =====
* Stationarity is a decision, not an hypothesis: it cannot be tested

* Stationarity assessment depends on scale

* It cannot be avoided


!split
===== Semi-Variogram =====
A core tool in measuring spatial continuity and geostatistical modeling

A model of the spatial continuity of variable Z in the variogram
It is a model of the average *dis-similarity* between points separated by *h*.
It measures the dissimilarity vs distance
