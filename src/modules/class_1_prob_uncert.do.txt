======= Data concepts, Data types and Models =======

===== Variables and Features, Labels and Instances =====
!bblock Population
Exaustive, finite list of properties of interest over area of interest. 
!eblock
Generally the entire population is not accessible

\pause 

!bblock Samples/experiments/instances
The set of values and location that have been measured.
!eblock
How many experiments are needed?

\pause

!bblock Features
The values to be measured for each sample/experiment/instance.
!eblock
How many features are needed? 


!split
===== Variables and Features, Labels and Instances =====

Predictors = input variables, $X_1$, ..., $X_M$

Response = output variables
 
\pause
!bblock Error
Deviation from ...  exact value (or expected value, mean value, trend...?)
!eblock

Errors without definitions are just number. 


\pause

!bblock Predictor and Response Features
Given a model $Y=f(X_1, ..., X_M) + e$ 
!eblock
!Here and error! But is it even an error?

!split
===== Descriptive and Predictive statistics =====
\pause 
!bblock Estimation
* Process of obtaining the best value or range of a propery in an unsampled location
* Local accuracy takes precendence over global spatial variabiltiy
* Not appropiate for forecasting 
!eblock

\pause 
!bblock Inference
* Predict unseen samples given assumptions about the population
* Test with a pre-trained model (ML definition)
* Generality versus Accuracy
!eblock


!split
======= Simulations =======
Process of obtaining one or more values of a property
* Improved Global accuracy 
* Better property distributions

\pause 

!bblock Why simulations then?
* We need to capture the full distribution of properties, extremes matter!
* We need more realistic models.
!eblock

\pause 
!bblock Why not?
* High dimensionality level
* Computationally expensive
* Convergence limitations
* Costitutive equations need to be rather accurate.
!eblock


!split
===== Uncertainity Modeling =====
_Given a model_, Generate multiple simulation to represent uncertainity
* Realizations: for the same input parameters, different random numbers.
* Scenarios: different input parameters.

=== Sampling rapresentative ===

!bblock Random sampling
Each item of the population has an equal chance of being chosen.

* Very expensive
* Mostly not interesting
* Gives some global properties
!eblock

\pause

!bblock Bias sampling
Selection of data is (arbitrarely) distorted
* Sample probability bias has to be corrected for
* Might not capture the global picture
* It might distort the system under study -> false results
!eblock


!split
===== Cognitive biases =====

* anchoring: The first bits are overconsidered
* availability: over-estimating the importance of info
* bandwagon: P increases with the number of people holding a belief
* blind spot: not seen biases
* choice supporting: commitment/decision dependent
* clustering illusion: seeing patterns in random events
* confirmation bias
* concervatism bias
* Recency bias
* Supervision bias
* Many many more!

!bblock Bias DO NOT cancel out! They sum up (or multiply?)
!eblock


!split
===== Data dimensionality =====
!bblock 1 D 
logs
!eblock

\pause 

!bblock 2 D: maps
Quite limited but great for visualization
!eblock

\pause 

!bblock 3 D 
3d maps, sysmic cubes. More informative mostly ok in digital formats.
!eblock


\pause 

!bblock 4 D 
Trajectories
!eblock

\pause 

!bblock x D 
Data realm
!eblock


!split
===== Types of data =====
\pause

* Categorical / Nominal (classes)
* Categorical / Ordinal
* Continous / Interval (e.g. Celcius)
* Continous / Ratio
* Discrete: binned/groupped data
* Hard data: direct measurements
* Soft data: indirect measurements, very uncertain
* Primary data: variable(s) of interest
* Secondary data: descriptors
* Collective variables
* Latent variables


!split
======= Uncertainity and Probability =======
Probability: there is not science more worthy in out contemplations nor a more useful one for admission to our system of public education

The theory of probabilities is at the bottom of nothing but common sense reduced to calculus.


\pause 

=== Clarity test ===

Beer drinker?

Rain in Stavanger?


!split
===== Uncertainity =====
* Def 1: Not knowing if an event is true or false. (Useful)
* Def 2: Things that cannot be measured. (Not useful)

\pause 

Probability is how Uncertainity is quantified!
* Clarity test
* Assign a number between 0 and 1 to our degree of belief 
* Error definition

\pause 
!bblock Sentence also good for fortune cookies
Uncertainity is the only certainity
