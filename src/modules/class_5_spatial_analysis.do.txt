===== Data Types =====
!bpop
o Petrophysical Properties (porosity, permeability, lithofacies types)
o Hard data (known with 'certainity') are taken from core measurements.
o Soft data: all other data types including well logs and seismic must be calibrated to hard data

!split 
===== Generit types of variable to be modelled =====
!bblock Continous 
* Definite range 
* Ordered
* e.g-
!eblock

!bblock Discrete Categorical
* Background with elements
* Mosaics: sedimentological Facies
!eblock

!split
===== Data mapping =====

For each variable, the chategory has to be properly chosen.

===== Modelling Scales =====
It is not possible nor optimal to model the reservpis poperties at the scale of the hard data
- core data must be scaled to some intermediate scale
* models are genereated

* Area of interest
* 1 injector and 4 produ es

Porosity and permeability distribution


!split
===== Spatial continuity =====
!bpop
* A wide range of spatial continuity are possible 
* Statial continuity impacts reservoir forecasts
* Error ranges has to be compatible with reservoire model sennsitivity analysis
* Covariance
* From 'very short' to 'anisotropic'

======= Spatial data declustering and debiasing =======
What is wrong with the following plot?


!split
===== Spatially Clustered Data =====
Data are rarely collected for their statistical representativity:
!bpop
o Wells are drilled in areas with the greatest probability of high production
o  

!epop


!split
===== Clustered Data =====
The original population is not the samples population (even without biases)


!split
===== Spatially clustered data =====
!bpop
* There is a need to adjust the histograms and summary statistics to be representative of the entire volume of interest
* Declustering techniques assign each datum a weight based on the closeness to surrounding fata
  * w_i =1, n
epop


!split
===== Cell Declustering =====
Another techniques, called Cell Declustering, is robust in 3-D and when the limits are poorlu defined: 
!bpop
* divide tge volume of interest into a grid of cell $l = 1, ... , L$
* count the occupied cell $L_0$ and the number in each cell $n_l$ for $l=1, ..., L_0$ 
* weoght inversely by number in cell (standardize by $L_0$)

!split
===== The Cell Size =====
Plot declustered mean versus the cell size for a range of cell sizes:

FIGURE: [../figures/cell_size, frac=1]

!bblock What cell size makes sense?
It is a good practice (but not theory behind) for taking the minimum declustered mean
!eblock

!bblock
The resul can ve very sensitive to large scale trends, it is often better to choose the cell size by visual inspection and some sensitivity analysis
!eblock


!split
===== Cell size =====
!bpop 
* Fix the size and change the origin (different desclustering weights)

* PErform an areal 2-D declustering when the wells are certical
* Perform a 3-D declustering when there are horizontal or hightly deviated wells that preferentially sample certain stratigraphic intervals
* Adjust the shape of the grid cells to conform to major direction of preferential sampling
* Could select the cell size, choose the cell size so that there is approximately one datur per cell in the sparsely sampled areas, the nominal spacing.
!epop

!bpop 
Without declustering, most geostatistical studies would be flawed.

===== Spatial Variation in Statistics: Moving Windows =====

===== Why spatial statistics? =====
Spatial statistics provides quantitative methods for
!bpop
o Evaluating the _spatial continuity_ and variability of spatial properties such as geological and petro-physical properties
o _Interpolating_ properties between wells and _extrapolating_ away from measurement points such as well
o _Integrating_ different property measuremsns with different _spatial resolution_ and _spatial sampling_. Different degrees of _reliability_
o Quantifying the _uncertainity_ in the spatial model due to the sparse data availability
