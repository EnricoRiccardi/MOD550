======= Statistics =======

!bblock Definition
Statistics is the science of acquiring and utilizing data
!eblock

!bpop
* It comprises tools for data collection, summarization, and interpretation.

* The aim is identifying the underlying structure, trends, and relationships inherent in the data.

* Is it all statistics then? Yes.

* _Numbers to data, data to information_
!epop



!split
===== Data properties =====
Before we talk about machine learning, we need to refresh some terminology.

!bpop
!bblock Population
The universe of all possible outcomes and events.
!eblock

!bblock Sample
A finite subset extracted from the population.
!eblock

!bblock Exhaustivity
The samples covered the population spectra.
!eblock

!bblock Representativity
The population is properly described by the samples.
!eblock
!epop


!split
===== Big data =====
We speak of big data when dataset are very large: i.e. many instances and features
Models have thus a large set of parameters (and often no one has a clue anymore of what is going on).

!bpop
* Volume of data
* Variety different types of data sources with different length and scale.
* Frequency of data generation
!epop


!split
===== Sampling =====

Samples shall have no bias (to be randomly selected). If not, the bias has to be corrected for.
!bpop
!bblock Cycle of data
o Data is collected
o Checked upon
o Some modelling
o Analysis and visualization
o AnOmLiEs and outliers detection (exclusion?)
!eblock
!epop

!split
===== Data expectation =====

FIGURE: [../figures/data, width=600 frac=0.8]


!split
===== Data quality =====

o Data has to be acquired and integrated
o Data are passed to a quality analysis and control
o Data cleaning, consistency check. Most of time goes here

!split
===== Modeling =====
* Predictive modeling (supervised learning)
Hunt for redundancy
Reduce dimensionality

* Complicated is not sophisticated... Linear regression is a type of supervised learning

* The model can be used to guide data acquisition (risky!)

* Machine learning enters here. It improves the *old* statistical analysis


!split
===== Visualization and reporting =====
* The data has to be condensed into a visualization to provide input for decisions.
* Depending on the goal, very very different visualizations are possible.
* Use a model to indicate what is undersampled or oversampled.


!split
===== Exploratory data analysis =====

!bblock Summarizing and visualizing data as a starting point for more analysis later on.

* Computing summary statistics (e.g. means and variance)
* Determining conditional probabilities of cause+effect relationships
* Calculating correlation and rank correlation coefficient between two variables
* Visualizing univariate, bivariate and multivariate data
* Estimating probability coverage levels for different distributions
* Analyzing behaviour of normal and lognormal distributions
* Calculating confidence interval and sampling distribution for the mean
* Testing for significance of difference in means
* Comparing two different distributions for statistical equivalence 
* Developing a nonparametric regression model from given data
* Reducing data dimensionality  
* Grouping data   

!eblock


!split
===== Random Variables =====
* A random variable is a real valued function that assigns a value to each outcome in the sample space
* A random variable (RV) can be either discrete or continuous
  * Discrete RV:
  * Continuous RV

* The probability mass function (PMF),p, of a discrete RV, X, denotes the probability that the RV is equal to a specified value, a.

p(a) = p(X = a)

* Similarly, the cumulative distribution function (CDF), F, denotes the sum

$CDF = \int^{\inf}_{-\inf} f(x) dx$

===== Sampling aim =====
* What are the effective sampling ,methods for predict the maintenance of wind turbine blades
(Time series?)

* How to sample and analyze Solar Panels fo determine the efficiency of the source

!split
===== Sampling approaches =====
* Sampling with replacement
  * The number of the members of the population does not change

xxx missing
* Sampling without replacement
 

!split
===== Examples =====
Pandas table

Goal of the analysis:
* Data interpretation
What does the number actually mean? And how do the different variables correlate?

* Data quality vs data cleaning
What are the error sources?

* Condense information (is the mean sufficient?)
We need to remove all unnecessary data without losing too much information.


!split
===== Univariate statistics =====
* Displaying data:

o xxx missing

!split
===== Example =====
a table
note: way too fast on the board

plot histogram: use vanilla, pandas, matplotlib

Does this histogram represent uncertainty?
No. It shows variability, but it can be used to quantify uncertainty.

!split
===== Class widths =====
* Class widths (bin sizes) are usually CONSTANT
  * the height of each bar is proportional to the number of values in it
* If class width are VARIABLE
  * the AREA of each bar is proportional to the number of values in it
* For small samples, the shape of the histogram can be very sensitive to the number and definition of the class intervals

!split
===== Sensitivity =====
Plot with different bin sizes.
This could be a fun exercise to lear python

* An average provides a common measure for comparing one set of data to another
* THe mean is influenced by the extreme values in the data set
* The mean may not be an actual element if the dataset
* The sum of all deviation from the mean is zero, and the sum of squared deviation is minimized when those deviations are measured from the mean

===== Distribution Models =====
* Uniform: useful when only upper and lower bounds are known
* Triangular: useful when estimates of min, max, mode [P10, P50, P90] are available
* Normal: symmetric model of random errors or unbiased uncertainties with mean of standard deviation specified
* very common for observed data
* additive processes tend to be normal as a result of the Central Limit Theorem
* log normal comes from multiplicative uncertainties with mean and standard deviation specified

===== Uniform Distribution =====
* The uniform distribution is useful as a rough model for representing low states of knowledge when only the upper and lower bounds are known.
* All possible values within the specified maximum and minimum values are equally likely (b=max, a=min):

===== Triangular distribution =====
* The triangular distribution can be used for modeling situations, where non extremal (central) values are more likely than the upper and lower bounds.
