===== Data =====

!split
===== Representation =====
A representation should _capture_ the nature of the subject being studied.

\pause 

Example:
If you want to evaluate the 3D structure of a wind turbine, a set of descriptors an be:
\pause 

o Blade length
o Turbine height
o Geographical position
o Output power
o Wind direction

which are two decimal numbers, a 2d tuple, a 1D time series and a 2D time series (or 3D even).


!split
===== Comparability =====
Same meaning _represenations_ for different objects (inputs).

!bblock Discussion point!
How do we compare two wind turbines accounting for the 5 variables
previously introduced?

!split
===== Data properties =====

* All starts from data: what are data-properties?

* Are there such things as good data and bad data?

!bblock Life lesson (or exam question, same thing ;) )
* Data color{red}{ DO NOT always} have value.

!split
===== Sampling point representation (SPR) =====

!bpop
* An intuitive way to represent curves and spectra is the _sampling point representation_.

* We sample at regular intervals where each sample point is represented by a variable

!split
===== Sampling point representation (SPR) =====
!bpop
* SPR is useful until point *i* in a curve has the same meaning of the point *i* in another curve.

FIGURE: [../figures/SPR-shift-problem, frac=0.5]

* Which parts of the profiles or shapes are comparable, i.e. have the same meaning?
!epop

!split
===== Data structures =====
Given a representation, it is then needed to decide on a suitable _data structure_ for the problem.

!bblock Definition
A data structure is a way of storing
 and organising data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

\pause

Typical data structures used in data analysis are:

  * Data points

  * Arrays (vectors, matrices, N-mode (way) arrays)

  * Graphs (trees)

  * Databases



!split
===== Workflow =====
Data has to be prepared with these steps in mind

!bpop
o Plan experiments: Use experimental design to set up experiments
  in a *systematic* way

o Pre-processing: Is there systematic variation in the data which should be removed  Can cross-checking/validation procedures be designed?

o Examine the data: Look at data (tables and plots). Strange behaviours? Smooth behaviour? WARNING!

o Define desired model outcomes (speed, accuracy, false positive/negatives rate)

o Estimate and validate model: What do the results tell us?  Is
  the generated model general (valid for future sampling)?

o Apply model to unknown samples

!split
===== Spatial and Temporal Data =====

 Statistics is collecting, organising, and interpreting data

\pause 

Spatial and temporal statistics is a branch of applied statistics that
emphasises:
o the geo context of the data
o the spatial and time dependent relationship between data
o the different relative value and precision of the data.


!split
===== Actual data =====

The data matrix is an extremely common data structure.

!bt
\begin{displaymath}
{\bf X}=  \left[ \begin{matrix}
95 & 89 & 82 \cr
23 & 76 & 44 \cr
61 & 46 & 62 \cr
49 & 2 & 79 \cr
\end{matrix}\right]
\end{displaymath}
!et

\pause 

In python these can be saved as
* lists (vanilla python)
* numpy.arrays
* pandas dataframes

!split
===== Nomenclature Reminder =====

There are different conventions.
Commonly we will construct data matrix such that:

* Rows are called instances, objects or samples.
* Columns are called features, variables.

One can think of each row to be an experiment, and the rows its properties.
Each row (experiment, object, sample, ...) is thus a list of values, one for property.

!bblock Note
Mathematically speaking, this is just a notation. As long as one keeps track and is consistent, columns can be used as rows and vice versa.
!eblock


!split
===== A quick example =====
Environmental measurements of rivers. The features (properties) can be:
* pH
* Temperature
* Concentration of pollutants
* Flow rate
* water speed
\pause
The experiments/observations/sample can be:
* Po
* Danube
* Rio delle Amazzoni
* Sjoa
* Atna
