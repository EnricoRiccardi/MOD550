===== Probability is how Uncertainity is Quantified =====

** Un-ambigous statement (Clarity test)
**

!split
===== Mathematically =====
Axioms:
** Non negative number
P > 0
** Unit measure, probabiliuty of the entire sample space $\omega$ is one (unity) 
Prob($\omega$) = 1 

** Additivity of mutually exclusive events (Independent)


!split
===== 3 main defintions =====

** Long term probability: Frequentist
Probability is a ratio of outcome
Requires repeated observation on an experiment

** Physical tendencies: objective probabilities
Knpwledge about the system
COuld know the P of an experiment without actually executing it

** Degrees of belief: bayesian probability
Reflect our uncertainity abput a result
Very flexible, assign provavility to anything, updating with new information when available

!split
===== Frequentist =====

Measures the likelihood that an event will occour-

For a random experiment

P(A) = lim(n(A)/n($\omega$))

!split
===== Venn Diagrams ======
Powerful visual tool to communicate probability.
Some names
** Samples
** Events
** Occurrence
** Sample space
** Union

A U B = ${x:x\  \in \ A \ or \  x \ \in \ B}$
** Intersection
A int B = ${x:x \ \in \ A and \ x \ \Ã¬n \ B}$

===== Frequentist =====
Example

### make a non petroleum example
Given 7 measurements 
We would like to assert the probability ofr the following events:
** Event A: porosity values less thant 0.15         P(A) = 3/7
** Event B: porosity values greated than 0.2        P(B) = 1/7
** Event C: porosity values between 0.14 and 0.17   P(C) = 3/7

Union of events: AUB, BUC, AUC
Intersection of events:
Complementary events:
All events: 1

!split
===== Properties =====
Addition rule
P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B) - P(AunionB)

!split
===== Example 1 =====
Given the figures, calculate
* P(A)
* P(B)
* P(A intersection B)
* P(A union B)

!split
===== Example 2 =====
Consider a fire-well campains with outcomes 1 or failure
We want to identify the event where exactly one well was suceafull
We can enumerate this as:
A = {(0,0,0,0,1), (0,0,0,1,0),(0,0,1,0,0),(0,1,0,0,0), (1,0,0,0,0)}

The probability for each element of A is p(1-p)^4, where 


!split
===== Conditional probability =====
Probability of B given that A occurred

P(B|A) = P(A union B)/P(A) = P(A and B)/P(A)

where P(A and B) is a joint probability, P(A) is a marginal probability
and P(B|A) is a conditional probability

### Nice figure

** Conditional probability
** Joint probability

!split
===== Margianl Conditional Joint Definitions =====
### nice figure

P(C|B,A) = P(A intersect B intersect C)/P(A intersect B)
P(B|A) = P(a intersect B)/P(A)

P(A int B int C) = P(C|B,A)P(B|A)P(A)

we land on the recursion of conditionals

P(A1 int ... int An) = P(An|An-1 An-2 ...A1)

!split
===== Conditional probability =====
Closure
P(A|B) + P(Ac|B) = 1
P(B|A) + P(Bc|A) = 1

===== Conditional probability - example =====

here two cases where P(A U B) = 0 and P(A inter B) = 0

===== Conditional Probability - example =====

assignemnt

** Calculate P(A|B) - frequentist
** Calculate P(B|A) 
The normalization will be different

### figure is needed for the example 


### Elect a student rapresentative for an early evaluation
### That is mandatory for all courses
### Pick a feedback group

If A and B are independent P(B|A) = P(B)

===== Multiplcation rule - example =====
Suppouse to have a deck composed by 52 cards (no jockers)
Four suites, each with 13 cards

P(heart and heart) = P(heart|heart)P(heart) =

===== Multiplication rule - example =====
A certain deseases affects 1% of the population, and there is a medical test for this desease
The test has
Sensitivity (True Positive Rate): the P that the test correctly identifies a sick person as positive is 95%
Specificity (True Negative Rate): the P that the test correctly identifies a healthy person as negative is 98%

### Make a plot showing True positive and True negative

!split
===== Evaluating Independence =====
Example
### Table here

* Event $A_1$ : afternoon most productive source is F1
* Event $A_2$ : evening most productinve source is F3

Are $A_1$ and $A_2$ independent?
is $P(A_1 int A_2) = P(A_1)P(A_2) or P(A_1|A_2) = P(A_1) and P(A_2|A_1) = ... $

Therefore, if we combine the two product rules and substitutes...

===== Bayes' Rule =====
Thomas Bayes (1702 - 1761), who was an Eglish minister nad (hobby) mathematician.

Laplace reformulated this theorem (independently).
$P(B|A) = P(A|B)P(B)/P(A)$
