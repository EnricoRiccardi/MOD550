_!Active Learning!_

!bpop
* There will be a combination of lectures and tutorials.

* Tutorial and hands-on will be presented during the course. 

* Study groups are strongly encouraged.

* In class discussions are encouraged at any stage.

!epop


!split
===== Python =====
The tutorials and hands on will be mostly based on python.

!bpop
* An introduction to python will be provided during the course. Yet, this is not a Python programming course! 

* You are _strogly advised_ to construct your own Git repository (and to keep it in order).

* Group projects will have different roles. 
!epop

\pause
For the next 3 weeks, you are welcome to join BIO510, where I will be providing an intro to Python.

With great power comes great responsability (Spider-Man)
!eblock

LLMs can and shall be used. As their development is surging in the last years, their help
in writing code and reports is undeniable. Studends shall learn how to master these tools. 
Yet, while their usage is encouraged, the risk of excessevily rely on them _DO_ hinder learning.

\pause 

If you want to be a student (i.e. whom is learning), you are encouraged to take the responsability in delivering original
output.

* In this course we will learn to use data and models (ML) to make better decisions. 
* Each application will be a mere exercise of the concepts we will here introduce.

!split
===== Uncertainity =====
It is present in every stage of life (at each decision).

You woud thus need to:
!bpop
o Rationalize uncertainity (qualify)
o Quantify uncertainity
o Make decisions under uncertainity
o Operate under uncertainity

!epop

!split
===== Uncertainity or Probability? =====

Our aim here is to provide a good guidance how to link data, models and output to value creation.

!bpop
* First we need to understand uncertainity and probability, and the difference between the two.

!bblock
* Spoiler: Probability is the language of uncertainity!
!eblock

\vspace{1em}

* We will analyse, quantify and structure models as a function of uncertainity.

* Clarity of language in probability is one of the hallmarks of decision analysis
!epop



!split
===== Data properties =====

* All starts from data: what are data-properties?

!bpop
* Are there such things as good data and bad data?

!bblock Life lesson (or exam question, same thing ;) )
* Data color{red}{ DO NOT always} have value.

===== Spatial and Temporal Data =====

Statistics is collecting, organizing, and interpreting data
!bpop

Spatial and temporal statistics is a branch of applied statistics that
emphasizes 
o the context of the data, 
o the spatial and time dependent relationship between data
o the different relative value and precision of the data.
!epop


!split 
===== Quantifying uncertainty =====
!bblock
On the data sources side
!eblock
* Confidence intervals
!bpop
* Relevance
* Significance
* Correlation
* Causation
* Data Filters
* Biases identification

!eblock
!bpop
* Regression
* Principal components
* Decision tree (random forests)
* Neural network
* Clustering
* Performance metrics
!epop

!split
===== Fields of application =====
* Spatial estimation of energy and mineral resources
!bpop

* Weather modeling: from aviation to agriculture
* Maintenance forecasting 
* Commodity, currency, stock and financial markets
* Market analysis
* Risk analysis
* ... and much much more!

!split
===== Hard and soft modeling =====

Models allow us to predict ’the future’, or describe the past and
present (what is the present...?)

\vspace{1em}

!bpop
!bblock Last life lesson for today
Models are always wrong, but some are userful. (George Box)
!eblock
!epop

\vspace{2em}

!bpop
=== Three main families: ===
o Hard models (physics)
o Soft models (statistic)
o Machine learning
!epop

!split
===== Hard modeling =====
!bpop

* Based on an accurate physical description of the system and mathematical modeling (e.g. differential equations). Hard models are often deterministic.

* Hard modeling methods usually use optimization methods to find out the best values for the parameters of the model.

* Hard modeling is preferable in laboratory experiments, where all the variables are controlled and the physicochemical nature of the dynamic model is known and can be fully described using a known mathematical model.

* Hard modeling, if successful, usually gives better understanding of a system and better extrapolations. Wrong assumptions often leads to non-sense results.
!epop

!split
===== Soft modeling =====

!bpop
* Soft-modeling describes systems without the need of an *a priori* physical or (bio)chemical model postulation. They are _data driven_ models.

* Soft models are much easier to make than hard models.

* Soft modeling can be used to understand complex relationships.

* Soft modeling needs (much) more data than hard-modeling.

* Soft models have a poor extrapolating capabilities (compared with hard-modeling)
!epop


!split
===== How to create hard models? =====
After understanding the problem to be solved we need to:

o Link mathematics to physics.
o Define boundary conditions and constitutive equations.
o Make tons of assumptions.
o Solve the constitutive equation in space and time.
o Check solution stability and sensitivity analysis.
o A long set of judicious approximations have to be taken.
o It is hard (but we are engineers!).
o Get quite some money for the awesome job.


!split
===== How to create soft models? =====

After understanding the general problem to be solved we need to:

* Determine a suitable _numerical description_ .
* Choose a suitable _model_ to which parameters are fitted.
* Train, test, validate the model.
* Perform _data analysis_ with chosen method(s).
* Link predictions with expectations.

===== Spatial and Temporal Modeling =====

!bblock
It is a branch of statistical analysis and model that uses spatial and time dependent data.
!eblock
!bpop
* Only a subset of statistical models can be fed with time dependent data
(most standard statistical method assume independent, identically distributed, data)

* Spatial and time related data come at a different range of scales
Frequency of data collection can be dependent of time and space,
resulting into different rappresentativity of a sample.
