===== Data vs Physics =====
FIGURE: [../figures/phys-data, width=100]

!split
===== Uncertainty =====
* Def 1: Not knowing if an event is true or false. (Useful)
* Def 2: Things that cannot be measured. (Not useful)

\pause

Probability is how Uncertainty is quantified!
* Clarity test
* Assign a number between 0 and 1 to our degree of belief
* Error definition

\pause
!bblock Sentence also good for fortune cookies
Uncertainty is the only certainty

!split
===== Uncertainty and Probability =====
!bblock Random quotes
* Probability: there is not science more worthy in out contemplations nor a more useful one for admission to our system of public education

* The theory of probabilities is at the bottom of nothing but common sense reduced to calculus.

===== Data properties =====
!bblock 1 D
logs
!eblock

\pause

!bblock 2 D: maps
Quite limited but great for visualization
!eblock

\pause

!bblock 3 D
3d maps, seismic cubes. More informative, mostly ok in digital formats.
!eblock

!split
===== Types of data =====
\pause

* Categorical / Nominal (classes)
* Categorical / Ordinal
* Continuous / Interval (e.g. Celsius)
* Continuous / Ratio
* Discrete: binned/grouped data
* Hard data: direct measurements
* Soft data: indirect measurements, very uncertain
* Primary data: variable(s) of interest
* Secondary data: descriptors
* Collective variables
* Latent variables



!split
======= Descriptive and Predictive statistics =======
\pause
!bblock Estimation
* Process of obtaining the best value or range of a property in an unsampled location
* Local accuracy takes precedence over global spatial variability
* Not appropriate for forecasting
!eblock

\pause
!bblock Inference
* Predict unseen samples given assumptions about the population
* Test with a pre-trained model (ML definition)
* Generality versus Accuracy
!eblock


!split
===== Variables and Features, Labels and Instances =====
!bblock Population
Exhaustive, finite list of properties of interest over area of interest.
!eblock
Generally the entire population is not accessible

\pause

!bblock Samples/experiments/instances
The set of values and location that have been measured.
!eblock
How many experiments are needed?

\pause

!bblock Features
The values to be measured for each sample/experiment/instance.
!eblock
How many features are needed?


!split
===== Variables and Features, Labels and Instances =====

Predictors = input variables, $X_1$, ..., $X_M$

Response = output variables
 
\pause
!bblock Error
Deviation from ...  exact value (or expected value, mean value, trend...?)
!eblock

Errors without definitions are just numbers.


\pause

!bblock Predictor and Response Features
Given a model $Y=f(X_1, ..., X_M) + e$
!eblock
!Here and error! But is it even an error?


!split
===== Finding a suitable model =====
!bslidecell 00

Soft modeling is in most cases
based on _multivariate statistical methods_. Many of
these methods may be viewed as sophisticated ways of
performing curve fitting to data.
!eslidecell

!bslidecell 01

FIGURE: [../figures/d0_0_2p1, width=400 frac=1]

What would be the best model?

* Straight?: $y(x) = ax + b$
* Parabolic?: $y(x) = a x^{2} + bx + c$
* Trigonometric?: $y(x) = a sin(x) + b cos(x)$
!eslidecell



!split
===== Uncertainty Modeling =====
_Given a model_, Generate multiple simulation to represent uncertainty
* Realizations: for the same input parameters, different random numbers.
* Scenarios: different input parameters.

=== Sampling representative ===

!bblock Random sampling
Each item of the population has an equal chance of being chosen.

* Very expensive
* Mostly not interesting
* Gives some global properties
!eblock

\pause

!bblock Bias sampling
Selection of data is (arbitrarily) distorted
* Sample probability bias has to be corrected for
* Might not capture the global picture
* It might distort the system under study -> false results
!eblock


!split
===== Cognitive biases =====

* anchoring: The first bits are over-considered
* availability: over-estimating the importance of info
* bandwagon: P increases with the number of people holding a belief
* blind spot: not seen biases
* choice supporting: commitment/decision dependent
* clustering illusion: seeing patterns in random events
* confirmation bias
* conservatism bias
* Recency bias
* Supervision bias
* Many many more!

!bblock Bias DO NOT cancel out! They sum up (or multiply?)
!eblock


!split
======= Simulations =======
Process of obtaining one or more values of a property
* Improved Global accuracy
* Better property distributions

\pause

!bblock Why simulations then?
* We need to capture the full distribution of properties, extremes matter!
* We need more realistic models.
!eblock

\pause
!bblock Why not?
* High dimensionality level
* Computationally expensive
* Convergence limitations
* Constitutive equations need to be rather accurate.
