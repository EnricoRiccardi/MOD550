======= Hard and soft modelling =======

Models allow us to predict ’the future’, or describe the past and
present (what is the present...?)

=== Three main families: ===
o Hard models (physics)
o Soft models (statistic)
o Machine learning
!epop

!split
===== Hard modelling =====

*  Based on an accurate physical description of the system and mathematical modelling (e.g. differential equations).
  Hard models are often deterministic.
!bpop
* Hard-modelling methods usually use
  optimization methods to find out the best values for
  the parameters of the model.

* Hard-modelling is preferable in laboratory experiments,
  where all the variables are controlled and the physicochemical
  nature of the dynamic model is known and can be fully described
  using a known mathematical model.

* Hard-modelling, if successful, usually gives better understanding
  of a system and better extrapolations. Wrong assumptions often leads to
  nonsense results.

!split
===== Soft modelling =====
Characteristics:

!bpop
* Soft-modelling describes systems without the need of an *a priori* physical or (bio)chemical model postulation. They are _data driven_ models.

* Soft models are much easier to make than hard models.

* Soft modelling can be used to understand complex relationships.

* Soft modelling needs (much) more data than hard-modelling.

* Soft models have a poor extrapolating capabilities (compared with hard-modelling)

===== How to create hard models? =====
After understanding the problem to be solved we need to:

!bpop
o Link mathematics to physics.
o Define boundary conditions and constitutive equations.
o Make tons of assumptions.
o Solve the constitutive equation in space and time.
o CHeck solution stability and sensitivity analysis.
o A long set of judicious approximations have to be taken.
o It is hard (but we are engineers!).
o Get quite some money for the awesome job.

!split
===== How to create soft models? =====

After understanding the general problem to be solved we need to:
!bpop

* Determine a suitable _numerical description_ .
* Choose a suitable _model_ to which parameters are fitted.
* Train, test, validate the model.
* Perform _data analysis_ with chosen method(s).
* Link predictions with expectations.
!epop

!split
===== Data collection  =====
!bblock (Reminder)
On the data sources side
!eblock

!bpop
* Confidence intervals
* Relevance
* Significance
* Correlation
* Causation
* Data Filters
* Biases identification
!epop

!split
===== Models and Methods  =====
!bblock
On the modelling side
!eblock
!bpop
* Regression
* Clustering
* Principal components
* Decision tree (random forests)
* Neural network
* Performance metrics
!epop


!split
===== Spatial and Temporal Data =====

!bblock Remember the definition?
 Statistics is collecting, organising, and interpreting data
!eblock

!bpop
Spatial and temporal statistics is a branch of applied statistics that
emphasises:
o the geo context of the data
o the spatial and time dependent relationship between data
o the different relative value and precision of the data.
!epop


!split
===== Spatial and Temporal Modelling =====

!bblock
It is a branch of statistical analysis and model that uses spatial and time dependent data.
!eblock
!bpop
* Only a subset of statistical models can be fed with time dependent data (most standard statistical method assume independent, identically distributed, data)

* Spatial and time related data come at a different range of scales. Data collection can be dependent of time and space, resulting in different representativity of a sample.
!epop


!split
===== Fields of application =====

!bblock
Tipical time and spatial data are:
!eblock

!bpop
* Spatial estimation of energy and mineral resources
* Weather modelling: from aviation to agriculture
* Maintenance forecasting
* Commodity, currency, stock and financial markets
* Market analysis
* Risk analysis
* ... and much much more!

!split
===== Finding a suitable model =====
!bslidecell 00

Soft modeling is in most cases
based on _multivariate statistical methods_. Many of
these methods may be viewed as sophisticated ways of
performing curve fitting to data.

FIGURE: [../figures/d0_0_2p1, width=400 frac=1]

What would be the best model?

* Straight?: $y(x) = ax + b$
* Parabolic?: $y(x) = a x^{2} + bx + c$
* Trigonometric?: $y(x) = a sin(x) + b cos(x)$
