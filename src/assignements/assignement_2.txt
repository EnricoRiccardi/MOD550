Deadline 18.2
1. Fix the mse_scaling_2.py code presented in the slides. Make sure to pass the test mse_vanilla == mse_numpy == mse_ske and print the time taken for each approach.
2. Make a function that makes data: 1d oscillatory function with and without noise.
3. Use LR,  NN and PINNS to make a regression of such data.
4. Plot the solution as a function of the number of executed iterations (NN and PINNs).
5. Plot the error in respect to the truth as a function of the executed iteration (LR, NN and PINNs).
6. Assume to not know the truth any longer, select a method to monitor the progress of the calculations and plot its outcome (LR, NN and PINNs).



==========================================
Delivery:

Make a Github open repository
(Make sure that I have access to your github repository)

Add a folder with name MOD550/data to store the outcome of your library
Add a folder with the name MOD550/code where you upload your code in .py format.
Name your program as exercise_2.py.





I should be able to download your program and execute it with a script. Be preside in the naming.
