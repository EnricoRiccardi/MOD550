Construct a class that is able to generate a 2D dataset. 

The 2d dataset can be: 2d random, noise around a FUNCTION, your truth (not a line). 

Use the classes previously created to generate 2 dataset, and add them. That is, append one dataset to the other.

Write a file with the data and save the plots. 

You also saved the metadata, right?!?

Save via git your dataset and import the datasets from someone else.

Generate/integrate the metadata file of the imported data, what truth the other group used to generate the data?
