* In this course we will learn to use data and models (ML) to make better decisions. 

* Each application will be a mere exercise of the concepts we will here introduce.

===== Uncertainity or Probability? =====

Our aim here is to provide a good guidance how to link data, models and output to value creation. 

!bpop
* First we need to understand uncertainity and probability, and the difference between the two.

!bblock
* Spoiler: Probability is the language of uncertainity!
!eblock

\vspace{1em}

* We will analyse, quantify and structure models as a function of uncertainity.

===== Data properties =====

* All starts from data: what are data-properties? 

!bpop
* Are there such things as good data and bad data?

!bblock Life lesson (or exam question, same thing ;) )
* Data color{red}{ DO NOT always} have value.

===== Hard and soft modeling =====

Models allow us to predict ’the future’, or describe the past and
present (what is the present...?)
