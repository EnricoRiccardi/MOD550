* Decisions are the hinge. What influences your decisions has value.

* In this course we will learn to use data and models (ML) to make better decisions. 
* Each application will be a mere exercise of the concepts we will here introduce.

===== Uncertainity =====
It is present in every stage of life (at each decision).

You woud thus need to:
!bpop
o Rationalize uncertainity (tualification)
o Quantify uncertainity
o Make decision under uncertainity
o Operate under uncertainity

===== Uncertainity or Probability? =====

Our aim here is to provide a good guidance how to link data, models and output to value creation.

!bpop
* First we need to understand uncertainity and probability, and the difference between the two.

!bblock
* Spoiler: Probability is the language of uncertainity!
!eblock

\vspace{1em}

* We will analyse, quantify and structure models as a function of uncertainity.

* Clarity of language in probability is one of the hallmarks of decision analysis

===== Data properties =====

* All starts from data: what are data-properties?

!bpop
* Are there such things as good data and bad data?

!bblock Life lesson (or exam question, same thing ;) )
* Data color{red}{ DO NOT always} have value.

===== Spatial and Temporal Data =====

Statistics is collecting, organizing, and interpreting data
!bpop

Spatial and temporal statistics is a branch of applied statistics that
emphasizes (1) the geo context of the data, (2) the spatial
and time dependent relationship between data, and (3) the different relative value
and precision of the data.

===== Hard and soft modeling =====

Models allow us to predict ’the future’, or describe the past and
present (what is the present...?)

o Hard models (physics)

===== Spatial and Temporal Modeling =====

!bblock
It is a branch of statistical analysis and model that uses spatial and time dependent data.
!eblock
!bpop
* Only a subset of statistical models can be fed with time dependent data
(most standard statistical method assume independent, identically distributed, data)

* Spatial and time related data come at a different range of scales
Frequency of data collection can be dependent of time and space,
resulting into different rappresentativity of a sample.

===== Quantifying uncertainty =====
!bblock
On the data sources side
!eblock
* Confidence intervals
!bpop
* Relevance
* Significance
* Correlation
* Causation
* Data Filters
* Biases identification

===== Quantifying uncertainty =====
!bblock
On the modelling side
!eblock
!bpop
* Regression
* Principal components
* Decision tree (random forests)
* Neural network
* Clustering
* Performance metrics
!epop

!split
===== Fields of application =====
* Spatial estimation of energy and mineral resources
!bpop

* Weather modeling: from aviation to agriculture
* Maintenance forecasting 
* Commodity, currency, stock and financial markets
* Market analysis
* Risk analysis
* ... and much much more!
