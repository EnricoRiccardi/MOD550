===== Where is the value ? Why this course? =====
Decisions are the cardinal. What influences your decisions has value.

Better results comes from better decisions. Note that this is a STATISTICAL argument.

Machine learning can be useful ONLY when they help taking better decisions.

** In this course we will learn to use data and models (ML) to make better decisions. 
** Each application is a mere exercise of the concepts we will here introduce.

===== Uncertainity or Probability? ======

Our aim here is to provide a good guidance how to link data, models and output to value creation. 

!bpop
First we need to understand uncertainity and probability, and the difference between the two.

Spoiler: Probability is the language of uncertainity!

We will analyse, quantify and structure models as a function of uncertainity.
