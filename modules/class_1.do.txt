======= Data concepts, Data types and Models =======
- Statistic
- Probability

===== Variables and Features, Labels and Instances =====
Total porosity: all pores
Effective porosity: all connected pores

Population: exaustive, finite list of properties of interest over area of interest. Generally the entire population is not accessible
* E
Sample: the set of values, location that have been measured.
* Porosity data

Predictor and Response Feature
Given a model Y(f(X1, ..., XM) + e

Predictors, = input variables, X1, ..., XM

Response = output variables



Predictive statistics
* predict the  samples given assumptions about the population
* where to drill the next well?

Descriptive versus inferentail Process
tretment group vs control group: statistical test to detemine if a difference is statistical significant


===== Hard models vs Soft models =====
Deterministic and Statistrical modeling:
deterministic: predictable
Statistical model: system process that has an uncertainity
Combinations: sparsely samples, heterogeneous, complex.

Deterministic: 
* physics and expert knowledge
* integration of various information sources
* very complicated

Statistical models:
* quick
* uncertainity assessment
* data driven approach
* phisics can be included
* stochastic modeling

=== Estimation ===
* Process of obtaining the single best value of a propery in an unsampled location
* Local accuracy takes precendence over global spatial variabiltiy
* Not appropiate for forecasting (too smoth)

=== Simulation ===
Process of obtaining one or more values of a propery at an unsampled location
* Glocal accuracy
* Better property discritubitions

Why simulations then?
* We need to capture the full distributgion of properties, extremes matter!
* We need more realistic models.


=== Uncertainity Modeling ===
Generate multiple simulation models to represent uncertainity:
* Realizations: for the same input parameters, different random numbers.
* Scenarios: different input parameters.

=== Examples ===
whatever -> transfer function to make a decision (dimensionality reduction)
* Ask questions before! The data are thereafter collected.
* The other way around might lead to highly correlated data.

=== Sampling rapresentative ===
Random sampling: when each item of the population has an equal chance of being chosen.
* Very expensive
* Mostly not interesting
* Gives some global properties

=== Prediction or inference? ===

Regular sampling: regular intervals
* less reliable
* resonance problems!

Data Collection:
* Random sampling
* Regular sampling
* How can we use sampling bias to improve the data?
* Biases have to be corrected thereafter!

* Preselection bias / survivor bias
(shut down plane)
* we know the outcomes only of the survivors
* cognitive bias


=== Cognitive biases ===
* Anchoring: The first bits are overconsidered
* Availability: over-estimating the importance of info
* Bandwagon: P increases with the number of people holding a belief
* Blind spot: not seen biases
* choice supporting: commitment/decision dependent
* Clustering illusion: seeing patterns in random events
* confirmation bias
* concervatism bias
* Recency bias
* Supervision bias
* Many many more!

Bias DO NOT cancel out! They sum up.

=== Data dimensionality ===
1 D 
well log
2 D 
maps
3 D
Sysmic

=== Types of data ===
* Categorical / Nominal (classes)
* Categorical / Orginal 
* Continous / Interval (e.g. Celcius)
* Continous / Ratio
* Discrete: binned/groupped data

Categorial -> ordinal or nominal scale
Continous Data -> Interval scale, ratio scale

* Hard data: direct measurements
* Soft data: indirect measurements, very uncertain
* Primary data: variable of interest
* Secondary data: descriptors


=== Coverage ===
What proportion of the population has data available?

e.g. seismic data:
Acustic impedence, cross section
Soft data


===== Uncertainity and Probability =====
Probability: there is not sceince more worthy in out contemplations nor a more useful one for admission to our system of public education

The theory of probabilities is at the bottom nothing but common sense reduced to calculus.


=== Clarity test ===
Beer drinker? Rain in Stavanger?


=== Uncertainity ===
* Def 1: Not knowing if an event is true or false. (Useful)
* Def 2: Things that cannot be measured. (Not useful)

Probability is how Uncertainity is quantified!
* Clarity test
* Assign a number between 0 and 1 to our degree of belief 

* Uncertainity is the only certainity
