===== Representation =====
A representation should _capture_ the nature of the subject being studied.

!bpop
Example:
If you want to evaluate the 3D structure of a wind turbine, a set of descriptors an be:
!epop
!bpop
o Blade length
o Turbine hight
o Geograpical position
o Output power
o Wind direction
!epop

which are two decimal numbers, a 2d tuple, a 1D time series and a 2D time serie (or 3D even).


!split
===== Comparability =====
Same meaning _represenations_ for different objects (inputs).

!bblock Discussion point! 
How do we compare two wind turbines accounting for the 5 variables
previously intoduced?

===== Sampling point representation (SPR) =====

!bpop
* An intuitive way to represent curves and spectra is the _sampling point representation_.

* We sample at regular intervals where each sample point is represented by a variable

!split
===== Sampling point representation (SPR) =====
!bpop
* SPR is useful until point *i* in a curve has the same meaning of the point *i* in another curve. 

FIGURE: [../figures/SPR-shift-problem, frac=0.5]

* Which parts of the profiles or shapes are comparable, i.e. have the same meaning?
!epop

!split
===== Data structures =====
Given a representation, it is then needed to decide on a suitable _data structure_ for the problem. 

!bpop
!bblock Definition
A data structure is a way of storing
 and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

Typical data structures used in data analysis are:

!bpop

  * Data points

  * Arrays (vectors, matrices, N-mode (way) arrays)

  * Graphs (trees)

  * Data bases
