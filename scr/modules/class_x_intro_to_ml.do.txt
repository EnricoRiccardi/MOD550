===== What ML can do ? =====

!bpop
o Handle too large dataset
o Handle dataset with too many dimensions
o Automate long repetitive and low value tasks
o Support decision making
o Implement expert assesment
o Provide visualization and analysis
o Improve models with data 
!epop

!split
===== Application examples =====
It all starts from the question! 

Is data fit for the task? 

!bpop
o Prompt anamolous operation conditions.
Frequency? Resolution? Interpretability? Variable types?
o Feature detection/guided interpretation.
Significance? Labeling strategy? Correlated data? Statistical interactions?

!spilt
===== General Work Flow =====
A predominant quantity of time/effort shall be dedicated to data retrival, preparation, interpretation.

!bpop
o Data preparation
o Model selection
o Model training and tuning
o Model testing, inference and validation
o Result intepretation

!split
===== Data preparation =====
The hands on operation begin with the data!

!bpop
o metadata preparation
o dataset preparation
o filtering
o cure data
!epop

!split
===== Metadata =====

Data without metadata are just numbers: useless.

Metadata quality is a necessary pre-condition
!bpop
!bblock What is metadata?
A set of data that described and fives information about other data [wiki]

======= Main Online Machine Learning python libraries =======
We will use a set of machine learning libraries:

!bpop
* "skilearn": "https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html"
Originally developed in affiliation with Google, it is the most used open source Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy.

* "pytorch": "https://pytorch.org/"
Originally developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella. It is free and open-source software.

* "TensorFlow": "https://www.tensorflow.org/"
Developed and owned by Google, is a free and open-source software library.

* "Deeptime": "https://deeptime-ml.github.io/latest/index.html"
A Python library for analysis of time series data. In particular, methods for dimension reduction, clustering, and Markov model estimation (scikit-learn based).

* "Keras": "https://keras.io/about/"
Keras is a deep learning API based on pytorch and sklearn.

===== Black box =====

Machine learning offers a (super) large set of statistical based tools that are, in essence, a black box. 

!bpop
!bblock Use with CAUTION!
As every black box, they are not fully reliable.
!eblock
!epop

Here some guide:
!bpop
o Use the simplest approach! 
o Consider approach quality! 
o Compare your results with benchmarks.
o Avoid not reporducible studies.
o Prioritize intepretability above computational speed and accuracy.
